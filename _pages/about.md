This is Zijing (Allen) Huang on the GitHub Page using [Jekyll & Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/)!

I come from China, went over to, Rock Hill, SC, United States for my last 2 years of high school for exchange student program during 2013. Afterwards, I graduated and attended Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. I study Computer Science and focus on web and mobile development. I am expected to graduate in December, 2020. I love playing video games during spare time. I play variety of types of games, sports, FPS, MOBA, etc. Currently I have a team named Just4Fun that consists 4 international students locating in different place including US and Canada. We are opened for more people like us who love playing games and enjoying creating contents to join us.
