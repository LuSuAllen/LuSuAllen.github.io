More guides on [here](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

I come from China, went over to, Rock Hill, SC, United States for my last 2 years of high school for exchange student program from 2013 to 2015.
Afterwards, I graduated and attended Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. I study Computer Science and focus on web and mobile development. 
I am expected to graduate in June, 2021.

I love playing video games during spare time. I play variety of types of games, sports, FPS, MOBA, etc.
Currently I have a team named Just4Fun that consists 4 international students locating in different place including US and Canada. We are opened for more people like us who love playing games and enjoying creating contents to join us.
